After not touching TVS in some time, I decided to finalize some of 
its general features, remove half finished features and essentially
clean up *most* of the code and get the site back to its initial
prototype design.  What you see here is TVS as I originally invisioned
it back in late 2006.  I have a gui in mind for the future based on
new ideas I developed while playing with TVS over the years...

    We'll see :)
